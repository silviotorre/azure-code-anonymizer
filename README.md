**Azure Code Anonymizer** is a web-based tool designed to detect and replace sensitive information within code snippets, particularly in **Azure and DevOps environments**. It enables developers and DevOps engineers to **securely share code** for debugging and analysis by anonymizing **connection strings, tokens, secrets, and identity-related data** before exposing it externally.
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚Äì Usage and Liability Limitations

The **Azure Code Anonymizer** is designed to detect and replace sensitive information (e.g., connection strings, IP/MAC addresses, tokens, secrets) within code, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. However, **this tool is provided "as is" without any explicit or implied warranties**, and its use is at the sole discretion of the user.

## üìå **Key Points**
### 1. **Anonymization ‚â† Removal of Intellectual Property**
   - Anonymizing sensitive data **does not mean** that the code is free from proprietary information.
   - Algorithms, data structures, and proprietary logic **may still be identifiable**.

### 2. **No Data Storage or Transmission**
   - All processing occurs **client-side** in the browser.
   - **No data is sent to or stored on external servers**.

### 3. **Use at Your Own Risk**
   - The user is **fully responsible** for reviewing the anonymized code **before sharing**.
   - The development team is **not liable** for any intellectual property violations or security risks resulting from the use of this tool.

### 4. **Risk Assessment Recommendation**
   - Before sharing anonymized code with third-party tools, a **risk assessment** is strongly recommended.
   - For highly sensitive or proprietary code, anonymization **may not be sufficient**, and additional precautions should be taken.

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:** This tool is provided ‚Äúas is,‚Äù without any guarantee of suitability for a particular purpose. By using it, you agree to these terms.
---

## **üöÄ Features:**
 - Client-side anonymization (**no data storage, no backend**).
 - **Regex-based detection** of Azure-related sensitive information.
 - **Customizable rules** via `anonymizer-rules.json`.
 - **Anonymization report** showing replaced items and line numbers.
